//TestNG is testing framework inspired from most popular JUnit framework used for the Java
//programming language. The TestNG framework is introduced to overcome the limitations of JUnit framework.
// Most of the automation users are using this framework because of its advantages & more supported features.
// Until we have executed selenium test script but not even generated test reports.
// So using this TestNG framework we will learn how to generate test reports.
//Advantages:
//In TestNG Annotations are easy to understand over JUnit.
//        1)In TestNG there is no constraint like you have to declare @BeforeClass and @AfterClass, which is present in JUnit.
//        2)As method name constraint is present in JUnit, such method name constraint is not present in TestNG and you can specify any test method names.
//       3) In TestNG enable you to grouping of test cases easily which is not possible in JUnit.
//        4)TestNG supports following three 3 additional setUp/tearDown level:
//@Before/AfterSuite, @Before/AfterTest and @Before/AfterGroup.
//        5)TestNG do not require extend any class.
//        6)TestNG allows us to define the dependent test cases each test case is independent to other test case.
//        7)TestNG allows us to execute of test cases based on group. Let’s take a scenario where we have created two set of groups “Regression” & “Sanity”. If we want to execute the test cases under Sanity group then it is possible in TestNG framework.
//        8)Parallel execution of Selenium test cases is possible in TestNG.
